Open source approach can enable new business models with great impact on how a physical artifact is designed, engineered and manufactured. But how does an open product should be conceived in order to activate those new models? How processes must be envisioned to be generative of an ecosystems of derivative products?

The workshop will first illustrate a series of case studies of open source tangible products whose design is enabler of a collaborative development process. The following hands-on session will then gather from a practical exercise where participants will be mentored to define “open features” able to trigger an open product ecosystem based on documentation, community platforms, step-by-step instructions and interfaces
